				<p>I am a second year student in University of Toronto studying in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was born in Taiwan, and immigrated to Canada in 2011. Having a multicultural background leads me to think broader and comes up with more unique ideas when designing. This portfolio is a place where I share my design philosophy and works related to engingeering design.</p>

			<dt id="realized" class="timeline-event middle"><a>"User experience is always my most concern"</a></dt>
			<dd class="timeline-event-content middle" id="realizedEX">
				<p style="white-space:pre-line;">When creating a design, there are many elements we need to consider about; and based on the situation, different factors weighs differently from one to another. For me, however, I always put user experience as the most important factors in my design. 
					
					From time to time, problems arise in our lives. They can be as big as needing a bridge to cross the river, or as small as wanting more space to write on the table. Many of them then being handled by engineers, who then design a solution to serve the needs for the people that encounter the problem. The end destination of a design always goes back to the people. Therefore, in my opinion, since we are designing for the user, I believe the user experience is the greatest factors of any design. Otherwise, if no one is willing to adapt the design, the initial problem is not solved; hence, the design itself becomes a failure to me.
					
					However, user-experience is not a factor that can be directed measured to distinguish whether it's good and bad; instead, it is a combination of lots of other factors. To deliver the best experience to users, we have to carefully choose the stakeholders and most important DFX(design for X). For example, in one of my project, in which we designed an extension to increase the desk's work area, since our targeted stakeholder are the students moving between classes, the portability become one of the top consideration when designing, and the functionality is reduced as long as it serves the need. 
					
					In all, my design philosophy is to always have the greatest empathy to the users, then, try to design something that deliver the best user-experience when in use.</p>

				•	Request for proposal: 
						To improve the living experience of a community in Toronto, out group contacted with Toronto Humane Society and Toronto Street Cat. In the conversion,the water freezing problem in winter for street cats arises and we worked on constructing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to address the problem.
				•	Matboard Bridge: 
						Our group used a 0.8X1.0m matboard to build a single supported bridge that was designed to maximize the failure load.
				•	Bridge Design: 
						In this project, my group was asked to design a 150 meter pedestrian bridge with detailed calculation and judgement to prove the feasibility of the design.
				•	Desk Extender: 
						Our group was assigned for a problem which indicates the lack of space on the most lecture hall tables reduces the productivity of the students. And we worked through the design process to come up with a final design aiming to solve this problem.
				•	Design Brief: 
						In this project, our team decided a "splarktz", which is something that annoys you in your life, and deeply investigated the problem to produce a design brief for other groups to design a solution. 
				•	Tear Down: 
						In this project, three different hairdryers were tore down and examined the inner and outer design. Then, design decisions were found in each hairdryer and I tried to chased down the reason behind making those decisions as well as compared the different design choices between the three.
